                Every year, Shaastra conducts a social campaign in an attempt to give back to society and create as big of an impact 
                on the lives of the people that we can with the audience that Shaastra amasses. <br /> Over the past years, we have 
                successfully carried out several campaigns such as SheCan, a campaign centered around upliftment of women, Blink, 
                a campaign to help the Blind community, and Pledge a Book, to help provide books to the underprivileged, with these 
                campaigns having been endorsed by a number of esteemed personalities, and helping a lot of people across all walks of 
                life.

                                With the motivation of creating an impact in both social and economic capacities, Shaastra has come up with - 
                                <b> Bubbles. </b>
                                <br /><br />
                                One of the basic necessities in developing India is to increase the hygiene condition in every possible way 
                                and washing hands is the foremost aspect in maintaining hygiene. We notice that most underprivileged schools 
                                do not take this seriously and avoid buying handwash.
                                <br /><br />
                                Also, in todayâ€™s world, resources are being depleted at an alarming rate and waste generated has also 
                                increased exponentially; the most feasible solution to this problem is to recycle and reuse.
                                <br /><br />
                                Under the campaign Bubbles, Shaastra aims to collaborate with hotels, companies and organizations from where we seek to
                                collect leftover used soap bars, These soap bars will  then be treated and recycled into hand wash solutions that will 
                                be distributed with help of NGOs in schools, street vendors and other public places to help increase the hygiene standards. 
                                The campaign will also include activities to promote hygiene awareness in schools and other public places in Chennai.

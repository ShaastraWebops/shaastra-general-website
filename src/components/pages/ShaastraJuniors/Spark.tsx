                        Spark is a national platform where students compete with each other across technical quizzes, 
                        case studies and presentations, and in the process improve themselves - all at no charge. Last 
                        yearâ€™s edition of the Spark Junior Quiz was conducted in 20 cities and saw a participation of 
                        more than 3000+ students across the nation. From introducing quizzing to students to organising 
                        a coveted nationwide inter school competition, Spark has been growing in multifolds since inception.
